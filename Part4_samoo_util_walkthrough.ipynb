    "# Setting up and Facilitating SAMOO Runs\n",
    "### Walkthrough of SAMOO Utility\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that Surrogate-Assisted Multi-Objective Optimisation (SAMOO) follows this general algorithm:\n",
    "1. LHS sampling of initial training dataset and starting population\n",
    "2. Complex model evaluation (hereinafter referred to as Outer Iteration)\n",
    "3. Pareto dominance evaluation\n",
    "     - if front converged: exit; else: continue to step 4\n",
    "4. (Re)training the GPR\n",
    "5. MOO with GPR replacing the complex model (hereinafter referred to as Inner Iterations)\n",
    "6. Resampling for new training points (also called infills)\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire process requires two models to be set up: a process-based model (PBM), which is a complex, expensive-to-evaluate model such as a groundwater numerical model, and a surrogate model, which is a fast-to-evaluate model, such as a GPR, that emulates the response of the PBM at some specified input parameters (i.e., decision vaiable values). PBM is run in Step 2 of the algorithm while the surrogate model is run in Step 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "pestpp-mou can be used to run both the outer and inner iterations of the SAMOO algorithm, where in the outer iteration it simply runs the PBM and records the results, and in the inner iteration it runs the MOO with the GPR surrogate model. To do this, we need to set up pestpp-mou control files for the outer and inner iterations. We have shown in the previous tutorial a glimpse of how this can be facilitated using the samoo utility. Here, we will show a more detailed walkthrough on how to set up the SAMOO runs using the utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need three sets of control files, along with input and template files required by pestpp-mou. For better housekeeping, we will place each set of files in separate template directories:\n",
    "1. template_outer -- for the outer iteration\n",
    "2. template_inner -- for the inner iteration\n",
    "3. template_repo_update -- for updating the outer iteration repository\n",
    "\n",
    "These will be generated by the samoo utility with the help of pyemu tools. Let us first load the files we need and the samoo utility.\n",
    "\n"
